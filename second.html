    <h1>how to sort a trash.</h1>
    <p>
        To sort trash, separate waste into different categories based on material type, like paper, plastic, glass, metal, organic waste (food scraps), and hazardous waste (batteries, electronics), placing each type in its designated recycling bin or disposal method; always check local guidelines to ensure proper sorting as specific rules can vary by region.
